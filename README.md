# Flutter FYI

This is a blog/website setup to document my learning journey with Flutter and Dart, starting with Flutter v2.2. While my initial exploration of Flutter focused on mobile (Android/iOS) app development, my current goal is to revisit this from three perspectives:

 * `Language` / Becoming proficient in Dart
 * `Cross-Platform` / Understand design and development patterns for use across mobile, desktop & web.
 * `Multi-Cloud` / Explore integration with backend cloud & AI services, and usage scenarios.

 ## Dual Screen and Foldables

 A secondary goal is to explore new user experiences enabled by the foldable class of mobile devices, with initial focus on dual-screen devices like the Microsoft Surface Duo. One way to do this is by simply using that device (or emulator) as my default development target for this learning journey.
