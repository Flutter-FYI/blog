      <description>The customary way to start any learning journey is with a &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; program. And by extension, the best way to kickstart a new blog is with a &amp;ldquo;Hello, Flutterverse!&amp;rdquo; post that talks about its motivation and objectives.

      <description>Welcome to the home page for @flutterfyi! This is a blog/website setup to document my learning journey with Flutter and Dart, starting with Flutter v2.2.
Cross-Platform App Development While my earlier exploration of Flutter focused on mobile (Android/iOS) app development, my primary goal now is to revisit this in three contexts:
 Language / Proficiency in Dart programming! Cross-Platform / Best practices for dev across mobile, desktop &amp;amp; web. Multi-Cloud / Integration with backend cloud, AI &amp;amp; support services  Dual Screen and Foldable Design A secondary goal is to explore new user experiences enabled by the foldable class of mobile devices, with initial focus on dual-screen devices like the Microsoft Surface Duo.</description>
