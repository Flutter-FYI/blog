The customary way to start any learning journey is with a "Hello World" program. And by extension, the best way to kickstart a new blog is with a "Hello, Flutterverse!" post that talks [about](/about) its motivation and objectives.

## Past History

I first learned about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) in late 2016 from a Google Developer Expert, in a DevFest conference talk. By 2017, there was a preview version to explore - and as a mobile developer, I was hooked. I spent most of 2017 and 2018 learning about Flutter concepts and sharing that journey in talks and workshops. The ecosystem was growing fast, the community was vibrant and welcoming, and I became an expert myself.

But in 2019, thanks to a career change and lots of travel, my Flutter exploration slowed down. I still found the framework and ideas amazing - but I didn't have active projects that I could use to devote time in skilling into the nuances of it. So I kept in touch with the community, read and shared interesting articles through my [social](https://twitter.com/flutterfyi) profile and waited for the right opportunity to dive back in.

Then in 2020, the pandemic hit. All events went online. My travels slowed to a trickle. And most importantly, I found myself in possession of a new mobile device - the Surface Duo - with a foldable form factor and dual screen capability! And it was an Android OS! I started getting back into mobile app development, with a secondary focus on exploring collaborative, multi-screen and cloud-native application development.

## Present Goals

My interest was rekindled by the release of Flutter 2.0 at [Flutter Engage 2021](https://dev.to/azure/a-visual-recap-of-flutterengage-my-5-takeaways-3gb1) in March this year, with the Surface Duo being featured as an exemplary device for exploring dual-screen apps and experiences for foldable devices.

Most importantly, Flutter had expanded its reach beyond mobile platforms, becoming a true cross-platform app development solution that supported mobile, desktop, web and embedded usage. The Dart language saw a big leap forward with null safety. And [Flutter 2.2](https://medium.com/flutter/announcing-flutter-2-2-at-google-i-o-2021-92f0fcbd7ef9) launched in May at Google I/O with more updates - including an [alpha for Windows UWP](https://flutter.dev/desktop#windows-uwp), [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-dart-sdk) for Dart, and a lot of new [content and codelabs](https://events.google.com/io/program/content?4=topic_flutter&lng=en) to walk through.

I want to explore it all - but with a clear set of long-term objectives in mind.

 * `LANGUAGE` - proficiency in Dart programming.
 * `DEVELOPMENT` - proficiency in cross-platform development (front-end).
 * `CLOUD NATIVE` - best practices for performant, agile solutions (back-end)
 * `USER EXPERIENCE` - innovative app ideas (foldables + multi-screen)


Added benefit? I recently had to reprovision my development laptop and start with a clean slate. That made me think - this was the perfect time to document setup and learning journeys with two kinds of audiences in mind:

 * `Myself` as customer zero. Documenting my learnings makes it easier to revisit later and copy snippets or refresh my understanding on specific features or workflows. (And to update them as they evolve!)
 * `Beginners`. Particularly visual learners (see [@SketchTheDocs](https://sketchthedocs) for examples of visual guides) and non-traditional developers (think career changers) who come into this realm with a potentially smaller built-in knowledgebase of terminology and concepts.


This blog is my canonical source - but I plan to republish these posts on my [dev.to/flutterfyi](https://dev.to/flutterfyi) profile to support discussions around these topics in a learning-friendly community!

Let's flutter forward!
