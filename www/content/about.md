Welcome to the home page for [@flutterfyi](https://flutter.fyi)! This is a blog/website setup to document my learning journey with Flutter and Dart, starting with Flutter v2.2. 

## Cross-Platform App Development
While my earlier exploration of Flutter focused on mobile (Android/iOS) app development, my primary goal now is to revisit this in three contexts:

 * `Language` / Proficiency in Dart programming!
 * `Cross-Platform` / Best practices for dev across mobile, desktop & web.
 * `Multi-Cloud` / Integration with backend cloud, AI & support services

 ## Dual Screen and Foldable Design

 A secondary goal is to explore new user experiences enabled by the foldable class of mobile devices, with initial focus on dual-screen devices like the Microsoft Surface Duo. One way to do this is by simply using that device (or emulator) as my default development target for this learning journey.
